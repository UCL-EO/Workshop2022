# Python setup

You need to use Python for running practical sessionss. The options are:

1. Use binder
2. Use Python on your own computer

We recommend you use binder, as we can guarantee the setup works there.

However, it is not very difficult to set up your own Python installation and to use that, should you so wish. 

The only thing you need to be aware of with binder sessions is that they are **volatile**, so any work you do there is only for that session. The next time you run binder, it will be gone. You can however easily download and save any files or notebooks you change or generate, using the Jupyterlab interface [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCL-EO/geog0133/HEAD?filepath=notebooks) 

## Use Binder

You can directly access all files and practicals via the link below:

## Install on your own computer

If you like, you can set up the notes and practicals to run on your own computer. Just follow the instructions on [running locallly on your computer](InstallAtHome.md). In that case, all files and sessions are saved. But it is a bit more complicated for you to set up, and more difficult for us to help you.
