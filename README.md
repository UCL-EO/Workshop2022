## Layout
* `data`: folder for data. Keep small e.g. CSV files etc here. If you need larger data, download via `postBuild` script. `carto` subfolder has maps of Ghana.
* `figures`: Figures, logos, ....
* `notebooks`: Where notebooks go
* `presentations`: pdf version of presentations (needed?)
* `wkshp_codes`: python code to be used by notebooks
